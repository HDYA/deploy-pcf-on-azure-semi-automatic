# Script to deploy PCF (OpsManager) on Azure

_Semi-automatic as there is still a large amount of configurations to be completed manually on `OpsManager`._

## Note

* `Azure Marketplace` or `ARM` template solution recommended (but they some times fail, hence there was this script)
* `Terraform` solution recommended
* Drafted years ago, already forgotten why it is not written for `bash` in the first place, `GO POWERSHELL~! GO WSL~!`
